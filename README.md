CSE 5522: Artificial Intelligence II
Lab 3: Hidden Markov Models and Viterbi's Algorithm
By: Jimmy Wallace

This repository contains the source code to complete CSE 5522: Artificial Intelligence II Lab 3 Hidden
Markov Models and Viterbi's Algorithm.

This lab aims to help students implement Viterbi's dynamic programming algorithm on a hidden markov
model. Given the provided data set, this repository implements Viterbi's algorithm to determine the
most likely sequence of discrete hidden states given an observed sequence of known random variables.

## Getting Started

To get started with this lab, first fork this repository and install the required python dependencies
listed in the included requirements.txt file.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Next, you can run the program with the following command

    python main.py

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

    Give examples

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

    Give an example

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

    Give an example

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
